# OpenIndiana Reimagined
## Welcome!
Welcome  dear user, you may be wondering what this site is, and not to worry this site is  a recreation of the "no-frills" OpenIndiana website, except more colorful and SaSS like, (without any services.)

## Why?
You may ask "why would you ruin a website like this, it puts OpenIndiana to shame." Even if it's harrowing for old users of the patform to see it like this, don't worry! This is to entice new people to OpenIndiana, people who may like server Operating systems, but want a nicer looking interface.

## Q/A
Q: Is this legal?
A: OpenIndiana is free and open-source, no copyrighted materials from them are used in this website, it also claims itself as a derivative site, and not an offical source.

Q: I [expletive] hate it! It looks so bad, make it better.
A: While I appriciate feedback, I don't condone harrasing of any kind on this platform. This includes me, any future dev team, OpenIndiana themselves, or other users, to request changes please submit an issue.

## Final Notes
Well, enjoy the site! If you want to contribute, simply email me at ribsai@outlook.com.
