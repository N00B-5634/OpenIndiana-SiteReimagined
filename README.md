# OpenIndiana Reimagined

## Welcome

Welcome to **OpenIndiana Reimagined**. This site is a personal reinterpretation of the original OpenIndiana website. While the design is based on the classic "no-frills" look, this version introduces a more colorful, modern layout, using SaS looks for styling. Please note, this site is not affiliated with or officially endorsed by OpenIndiana, and it does not offer any official services related to the platform. However, it does link to the official OpenIndiana site for downloads and other resources.

## Why This Redesign?

You might be wondering why I decided to make this change to the website. The original OpenIndiana site has a very simple, minimalistic design. While this works for some, the goal of this redesign is to offer a more visually engaging experience for people who might find the traditional design too plain. The aim is to make the site more approachable, particularly for those interested in server operating systems but who might prefer a more modern interface. This site is not meant to replace or undermine the original design but rather to present an alternative that may appeal to a different audience.
